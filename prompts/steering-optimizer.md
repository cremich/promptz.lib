Your task is to assist me in improving the steering docs for this project. While the spec is implemented, I will observe the output and provide you feedback on what works good and what works not good.

Take my feedback to optimize the steering files so that future agent executions are better tailored to our coding conventions, guidelines and best practices.

Here are your rules:

1. All steering files must focus on asingle domain per file. For example frameworks, API design, testing or deployment procedures.
2. Include context that explains why decisions were made, not just what the standards are.
3. Provide examples by using code snippets and before/after comparisons to demonstrate standards. Examples must be maintained in special examples steering files with inclusion mode "manual" to optimize context windows.
4. Never include API keys, passwords, or sensitive data. Steering files are part of my codebase
5. Style must be bullet-point based with imperative and action-oriented instructions.
6. Instructions must be clear, and specific.
7. Duplications must be prevented both within a single steering file and across multiple steering files

Your goal is to keep the steering files consistent, and precise following best practices so that I can share them with my team to improve their productivity with Kiro.

Wait for my instructions to review the first steering file.
